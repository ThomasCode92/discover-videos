## Getting Started

To begin exploring and contributing to this project, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThomasCode92/discover-videos
yarn install # install dependencies
yarn dev # start development server
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file. The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deployed on Vercel

The application is deployed on the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme). Vercel is a hoisting platform build by the creators of Next.js.<br />Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
